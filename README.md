## Features

**Room System**
- Admin creates a quiz room with a unique 6-character code (e.g., `A3X7K2`)
- Shareable join link: `yoursite.com/?room=A3X7K2` — pre-fills the code for players
- One room at a time — simple, no conflicts

**Admin Panel** (`/admin.html`)
- PIN-protected access (default: `1234`)
- Add custom questions from scratch for each quiz (text, 4 options, correct answer)
- Set question timer (5–120 seconds)
- Create quiz room → get room code + shareable link
- See players join in real time
- Start game → 10-second "Get Ready" countdown
- During game: see current question, countdown timer, live leaderboard, answer stats (correct/wrong count)
- Advance to next question manually (admin controls pacing)
- Game over: see full final leaderboard
- Create new quiz (resets everything for a fresh start)

**Player Experience** (`/`)
- Enter room code + nickname to join
- No control buttons — admin runs the entire game
- See questions + answer options + countdown timer
- Pick an answer → "Answer locked!" confirmation → wait for timer
- Correct answer revealed to everyone when timer expires
- See personal result (correct/wrong + score earned)
- Game over: see personal rank and total score

**Scoring**
- Millisecond precision — faster correct answers earn more points
- Score range: 0–1000 per question
- Formula: `score = 1000 × (time_remaining / total_time)`
- Example: 15-second timer, answer in 0.35 seconds → score ≈ 977
- Wrong answers = 0 points
- Leaderboard ranks by total cumulative score

**Architecture**
- Single binary (14 MB) with everything embedded
- SQLite database created automatically at startup
- Real-time sync via WebSocket (gorilla/websocket)
- Server-side timers for countdown and question time limits
- No external services needed

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24+** (for building from source)
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment) — OR —
- Any Linux/macOS/Windows machine (for running the binary)

> SQLite is compiled into the binary. No database server needed.

---

## Getting Started (Local)

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakh1l/quizhub.git
cd quizhub
make build    # or: go build -o quizhub ./cmd/server
```

### 2. Run

```bash
./quizhub
```

Output: `QuizHub v1.0.0 running on http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Open in browser

| URL                              | Who          |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| `http://localhost:8080`          | Players      |
| `http://localhost:8080/admin.html` | Quiz host  |

### 4. Run a quiz

1. **Admin**: Open `/admin.html` → enter PIN `1234`
2. **Admin**: Add a few questions using the form
3. **Admin**: Click **Create Quiz Room** → copy the room code
4. **Players**: Open `/` → enter room code + nickname → click **Join Room**
5. **Admin**: Click **Start Game** when everyone's in
6. **Everyone**: Answer questions, watch scores, have fun!

---

## Deployment

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build
docker build -t quizhub .

# Run
docker run -d \
  --name quizhub \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v quizhub-data:/app/data \
  -e QUIZHUB_ADMIN_PIN=your-secret-pin \
  quizhub
```

Verify: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health`

Open `http://your-server-ip:8080` in a browser.

### Option B: Bare Binary on a VPS

```bash
# Build for your target
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o quizhub ./cmd/server

# Copy to server
scp quizhub user@your-server:/opt/quizhub/

# Create systemd service
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/quizhub.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=QuizHub Trivia Game
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=quizhub
WorkingDirectory=/opt/quizhub
ExecStart=/opt/quizhub/quizhub
Restart=on-failure
Environment=QUIZHUB_PORT=8080
Environment=QUIZHUB_DB=/opt/quizhub/data/quizhub.db
Environment=QUIZHUB_ADMIN_PIN=your-secret-pin

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Start
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now quizhub
```

**Add Nginx + HTTPS** (important for WebSocket):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name quiz.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Then: `sudo certbot --nginx -d quiz.yourdomain.com`

### Option C: Docker Compose (with HTTPS)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  quizhub:
    build: .
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - quizhub-data:/app/data
    environment:
      - QUIZHUB_PORT=8080
      - QUIZHUB_ADMIN_PIN=change-this
    expose:
      - "8080"

  caddy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy-data:/data

volumes:
  quizhub-data:
  caddy-data:
```

```
# Caddyfile
quiz.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy quizhub:8080
}
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Scoring

| Scenario | Score |
|----------|-------|

make test

# Coverage report
make cover

# Quick smoke test
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `bind: address already in use` | Change port: `QUIZHUB_PORT=3000 ./quizhub` |
| WebSocket not connecting | Ensure Nginx forwards `Upgrade` headers (see deployment section) |
| "Invalid room code" | Room was reset — admin needs to create a new room |
| "Game already in progress" | Players can't join mid-game — wait for reset |
| Admin returns 401 | Include `X-Admin-Token` header from `/api/admin/auth` |
| Binary won't run | Rebuild with correct `GOOS`/`GOARCH` for your server |
